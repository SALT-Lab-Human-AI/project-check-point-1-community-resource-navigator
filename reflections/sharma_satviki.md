1. A Primer on Word Embeddings: AI Techniques for Text Analysis in Social Work (Brian E. Perron et al., 2024)

Link: arXiv PDF

Summary: This paper introduces word embeddings and related AI methods for social work research, showing how vector representations capture semantic meaning in unstructured text. It highlights applications like analyzing housing support requests and detecting patterns in social needs.

3 Insights Learned:

Embeddings enable more nuanced matching than keyword search.

Pretrained models can transfer effectively to social domains with limited data.

Visualization of embeddings helps in uncovering hidden patterns in text.

2 Limitations/Risks:

Potential bias in pretrained models reflecting societal stereotypes.

Requires careful preprocessing and domain adaptation to avoid misinterpretation.

1 Idea for Project: Use sentence embeddings (e.g., MiniLM) to power semantic search in the Community Resource Navigator for matching user queries to services.

2. ASHABot: An LLM-Powered Chatbot to Support the Informational Needs of Community Health Workers (Ramjee et al., 2024)

Link: arXiv PDF

Summary: ASHABot is a WhatsApp-based chatbot leveraging open-source LLMs to answer questions from community health workers. The study focuses on usability, response accuracy, and expert-in-the-loop design.

3 Insights Learned:

Lightweight deployment (e.g., via messaging apps) increases accessibility.

Human-in-the-loop validation improves trust and correctness.

Domain-specific fine-tuning isn’t always needed if prompts are carefully engineered.

2 Limitations/Risks:

Reliability depends heavily on internet access and device compatibility.

Risk of misinformation if responses aren’t periodically verified.

1 Idea for Project: Deploy a simple chatbot via Streamlit or even messaging apps to simulate real-world accessibility.

3. Towards Semantic Search for Community Question-Answering Platforms (Rahmani et al., 2021 – di-2021_final_17.pdf)

Link: Workshop PDF

Summary: This work explores combining semantic embeddings (Sentence-BERT) with classical IR models (BM25) to improve retrieval in community Q&A platforms. It shows that hybrid approaches outperform single methods.

3 Insights Learned:

Pure embeddings sometimes miss exact keywords—hybrids are stronger.

Fine-tuning embeddings on domain data boosts accuracy.

Retrieval is critical before generation—garbage in, garbage out.

2 Limitations/Risks:

Requires careful balancing of semantic vs lexical weighting.

Computational cost increases when combining models.

1 Idea for Project: Use hybrid BM25 + MiniLM semantic search for robust retrieval of community service entries.

4. Chatbot for Social Need Screening and Resource Sharing (DAPHNE) (Sezgin et al., 2024 – humanfactors-2024-1-e57114.pdf)

Link: JMIR Human Factors PDF

Summary: Describes iterative design and evaluation of DAPHNE, a chatbot for identifying social needs and linking families to resources. Focuses on design process, usability testing, and early adoption results.

3 Insights Learned:

Iterative design with user testing greatly improves adoption.

Users value empathetic tone as much as accuracy.

Structured outputs (service name, hours, eligibility) are more helpful than long text.

2 Limitations/Risks:

Hard to keep datasets updated with real-time resource info.

Potential mismatch between chatbot responses and complex human needs.

1 Idea for Project: Add a structured “card-style” response for each service query to make info more digestible.

5. Laying a Community-Based Foundation for Data-Driven Semantic Standards (Mattingly et al., 2016)

Link: EHP PDF

Summary: Focuses on building shared data standards in public health research, especially integrating diverse datasets. Advocates for interoperability and standardized metadata.

3 Insights Learned:

Consistency in how data is labeled is critical for reusability.

Metadata standards prevent fragmentation across projects.

Community-driven vocabularies make data more accessible.

2 Limitations/Risks:

Developing standards is time-consuming.

Risk of excluding local nuances if standards are too rigid.

1 Idea for Project: Create a simple schema for your community services dataset (name, address, hours, eligibility) so it can be reused/extended later.

6. Significant-Attributed Community Search in Heterogeneous Information Networks (Liu et al., 2023)

Link: arXiv PDF

Summary: Proposes algorithms for community search in heterogeneous graphs with attributes, allowing discovery of dense sub-communities based on semantic constraints.

3 Insights Learned:

Graph-based models can uncover relationships between different resource types.

Attribute constraints help filter results more meaningfully.

Efficient search is possible even in large, heterogeneous networks.

2 Limitations/Risks:

Complex to implement without significant data engineering.

Hard to explain results to non-technical users.

1 Idea for Project: Future iteration could model services as a graph (nodes = services, edges = shared categories) to enable smarter recommendations.

7. Smart Community Health: A Comprehensive Community Resource Recommendation Platform (Mekni & Haynes, 2020)

Link: ScitePress PDF

Summary: Presents a platform that integrates data sources to recommend community health services. Focuses on architecture, modules, and evaluation of prototype system.

3 Insights Learned:

Multi-modal data integration (web, mobile) improves reach.

Recommendation engines can personalize resource delivery.

Community-specific tailoring is key to adoption.

2 Limitations/Risks:

Scalability issues if datasets grow too large.

Reliance on external APIs can cause fragility.

1 Idea for Project: Build a lightweight recommender feature (“you might also need X service”) as an extension of the chatbot.

8. Social Need Screening Chatbot (SSRN Preprint) (Sezgin et al., 2023 – ssrn-4662290.pdf)

Link: SSRN PDF

Summary: Early preprint version of the DAPHNE chatbot paper. Describes motivations, pilot design, and planned evaluations for a chatbot addressing vulnerable families’ needs.

3 Insights Learned:

Stakeholder buy-in is critical for sustainability.

Mock datasets are sufficient for early testing.

Parents value both educational and resource-linking features.

2 Limitations/Risks:

Preprint lacks extensive evaluation data.

Narrow focus may not generalize beyond specific settings.

1 Idea for Project: Start with synthetic/mock datasets to validate your prototype before seeking real-world integration.
