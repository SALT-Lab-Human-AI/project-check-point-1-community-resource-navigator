# Community Resource Navigator

The **Community Resource Navigator** is an AI-powered tool designed to help local residents quickly find information about community services such as food pantries, free clinics, job training programs, ESL classes, and housing support. By providing a simple, conversational interface, the project aims to make it easier for people—especially new immigrants, elderly residents, and low-income families—to access resources without the confusion of scattered websites or outdated flyers.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals
- Centralize community service information in one accessible platform.
- Provide a natural language chatbot interface for asking questions like:
  - *“Where is the nearest food pantry?”*  
  - *“How do I sign up for free job training?”*  
- Auto-generate summaries of service details (hours, contact info, eligibility).
- Support multilingual queries for inclusivity.
